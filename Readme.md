## Overview

Welcome to the **DevOps Project** by Jibran! This project demonstrates a seamless CI/CD pipeline setup using Jenkins, Docker, AWS RDS, and EC2. It is designed to showcase best practices in DevOps, focusing on automation, containerization, and cloud-based deployment. The pipeline is set up to automatically deploy a Node.js application with CRUD operations for user management, utilizing AWS RDS for database storage, Docker for containerization, and Jenkins for continuous integration and delivery.

## Key Features

- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Fully automated build, test, and deployment pipeline.
- **Docker**: Containerization of the application for easy deployment and scalability.
- **AWS RDS**: Relational Database Service (RDS) for managing user data in a cloud environment.
- **AWS S3**: Integration with S3 for storing and retrieving user files.
- **EC2 Deployment**: Seamless deployment of the application to AWS EC2 instances.
- **Jenkins Integration**: Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline powered by Jenkins.
  
## Project Setup
